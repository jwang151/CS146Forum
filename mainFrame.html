            This is group 9's website project. For our project we created a forum with the goal of making a website that can create new dialouges and pages based upon user submission. 
            We want to be able to add comments and different types of media to the pages that are created. Unfortunatly none of this will be saved as that would require the creation
            of a database, which is outside the scope of our knowlege. (NOTE: the color scheme is supposed to be stevens themed)
